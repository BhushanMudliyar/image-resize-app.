To build an image resize app, you will need to use a server-side programming language like Python, Ruby, Java, or PHP. You will also need to use a library or framework that provides image processing capabilities, such as Pillow (Python), MiniMagick (Ruby), or ImageMagick (Java, PHP).

Here is an outline of the steps you will need to follow:

Create a form for the user to upload an image and enter the desired width and height.
When the form is submitted, use the server-side language to save the uploaded image to a temporary location on the server.
Use the image processing library to open the image and resize it to the specified width and height.
Save the resized image to a permanent location on the server, or generate a URL that can be used to access the image.
Display the resized image to the user, or provide a link that they can use to download the image.

Example code using Python and the Pillow library:

from PIL import Image

# Open the image and resize it
image = Image.open('original.jpg')
image = image.resize((400, 300))

# Save the resized image
image.save('resized.jpg')

You can also use this code to generate a URL for the resized image, instead of saving it to the server. Simply create a route that reads the image from memory and returns it as a response, like this:


from flask import Flask, send_file

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/resized/<int:width>/<int:height>')
def resized_image(width, height):
    # Open the image and resize it
    image = Image.open('original.jpg')
    image = image.resize((width, height))

    # Save the image to a temporary buffer
    buffer = BytesIO()
    image.save(buffer, format='JPEG')
    buffer.seek(0)

    # Return the image as a response
    return send_file(buffer, mimetype='image/jpeg')
